# XML

Modular XML Coding Test

<br/>In this notebook, there will be 3 main questions that will be addressed. For the 3 questions, I have utilised Google Colab as my IDE, and have done the programming on Colab. I have put in my thought processes for the issues that I have faced for all the questions during this coding test within this README file.

<br/>For Question 1, it is to use Python to convert all rows in “Output_Values” into XML format, and name it "Output.xml".

<br/>Attached are the relevant files:

1. Output.xml
2. Q1.py

<br/>For Question 2, it is to use Python to convert FX_MAS_NEWT_OTHR.xml into CSV format, and name it CSV_Output.csv.

<br/>Attached are the relevant files:
1. CSV_Output.csv
2. Q2.py

<br/>For Question 3 and 4, It is to webscrape the CC of India's financial data, and upload it to SQL via BCP utility, to automate it every hour using Crontab, and parsing it to the SQL database. 
Attached are the relevant files:

1. Q3.py
2. Security_Wise_Holdings.csv
3. Cronjob 1 Hour Colab Automation
4. BCP Utility Error.png
5. Bulk Insert SQL.png
